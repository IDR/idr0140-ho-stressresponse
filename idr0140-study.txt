Protocol Description	"The 322 GFP-tagged strains were grown to mid- logarithmic phase in liquid Synthetic Defined (SD) media and imaged on a 384-well imaging plate (PerkinElmer 384 Cell Carrier Ultra, 6057300) in a high-throughput confocal microscope (PerkinElmer Opera High-Content Screening System) as previously described. Briefly, cells were treated with 200mM HU or 0.03% MMS and imaged at 7 timepoints over 4 hours (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes). The addition of drug to each column of the plate was staggered by 1 minute to compensate for the imaging time of the Opera microscope. For each time point, 4 different regions of the well were imaged. Both GFP and RFP was imaged on the microscope with 800 ms exposure. Cells expressed a constitutively cytoplasmic tdTomato fluorophore, and whole cell image segmentation was conducted using CellProfiler based on tdTomato signal. Dead cells displaying high GFP fluorescence were removed from the analysis. An automated quantification scheme was developed using custom written Python scripts to acquire measurements of GFP pixel intensities for each individual cell from all obtained images.

# Phenotypes					
Phenotype Name	change in protein localization				
Phenotype Description	"Single cell pixel intensity distributions were normalized by the median GFP intensity measured for each respective cell. For a given protein, the 95th percentile, hereafter referred to as the localization (LOC) value, was determined for each distribution among untreated cells. The median (x) and median absolute distribution (MAD) was calculated for the loc value and were used to determine threshold values for changes in protein localization. If a cell LOC value was greater than 2 MAD from the median (x + 2 MAD), it was considered as an increase in protein relocalization from the untreated condition. Conversely, if a cellular LOC value was less than 2 MAD from the median (x - 2 MAD), it was labeled as decreased localization from the untreated condition. The LOC value was calculated for all cells among all proteins and across all 7 timepoints in our study. Finally, the percentage of cells with a localization change was calculated by dividing the number of proteins with a localization change event (either increased or decreased) by the total number of cells segmented."
